<h1 align="center">The data sinks</h1>

<p>When the ADwin takes data during a sweep, this data can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>stored in a JavaScript variable</li>
<li>saved to a file</li>
<li>sent to a plotter for real-time visualization</li>
</ul>

<p>All these possible destinations of data are collectively known as
<i>data sinks</i>. Thus a data sink is simply something that can accept
incoming data in real time. There are therefore three types of data
sinks:</p>

<ul>
<li>variable data sinks</li>
<li>file data sinks</li>
<li>tsv data sinks</li>
<li>plot data sinks</li>
</ul>

<p>Each one of these types is discussed below. You can attach data sinks
to a sweep by defining the <code>variable</code>, <code>file</code> and
<code>plot</code> properties on the sweep, as in the following
example:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> a_sweep = {
    outputs: {Vds: +3},         <span class="comment">// sweep bias voltage</span>
    inputs: "<span class="string">I</span>",                <span class="comment">// measure current</span>
    variable: {                 <span class="comment">// store data in variable "sweep"</span>
        name: "<span class="string">sweep</span>",
        columns: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"]
    },
    save: {                     <span class="comment">// save data to file sweep.json</span>
        filename: "<span class="string">sweep.json</span>",
        columns: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"]
    },
    plot: {                     <span class="comment">// plot data on plot "sweep"</span>
        name: "<span class="string">sweep</span>",
        axes: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"]
    }
};</code></pre>

<h2>Variable data sinks</h2>

<h3>Defining a variable data sink</h3>

<p>A variable data sink is a JavaScript object that describes how to
store the measured data in a JavaScript variable. Below is a more
complete example of a variable data sink:</p>

<pre><code>variable: {
    name: "<span class="string">sweep</span>",
    columns: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"],
    metadata: {
        comment: "<span class="string">Let's take an I(V) at zero field, zero gate</span>",
        temperature: 4.5
    },
    transform: <span class="keyword">function</span>(x) {<span class="keyword">return</span> [x[0]-0.03, x[1]];} <span class="comment">// fix Vds offset</span>
}</code></pre>

<p>The keys, their type and their meaning is the following:</p>

<dl>

    <dt>name (string)</dt>
    <dd>Name of the JavaScript global variable that will hold the data.
    Use the name of the variable, not the variable itself. If the
    variable does not already exist, it will be created. If it exists
    but is not an object, it will be overwritten. Otherwise the new data
    will just be appended to it.</dd>

    <dt>reference (object)</dt>
    <dd>JavaScript variable that will hold the data. Use the variable
    itself, not its name. The variable has to exist and hold an object.
    <b>Warning</b>: every variable data sink has to have either a
    <code>name</code> or a <code>reference</code> property, but not
    both.</dd>

    <dt>columns (array of strings)</dt>
    <dd>List of (input or output) channels whose values are to be saved
    as data columns in the variable. Default is all the channels listed
    as outputs or inputs (in that order) on the current sweep.</dd>

    <dt>metadata (object)</dt>
    <dd>This can contain any extra information you want to add to
    document the measurement done in this particular sweep. Use any keys
    you like exept <code>sweep</code>, <code>columns</code>,
    <code>start</code> and <code>data</code>. This can be specially
    useful if you later <code>save()</code> the variable to a file.</dd>

    <dt>transform (function)</dt>
    <dd>Optional function that will apply a mathematical transformation
    to the data. The function should take one single parameter: an array
    of raw data, and return an array of transformed data. The input
    array's length will be the length of the columns property
    above. The output array may have a different length. The function
    may also return <code>null</code>, meaning that this particular data
    point is to be discarded.</dd>

    <dt>output (array of strings)</dt>
    <dd>Optional array with the names you want to give to the outputs of
    the <code>transform</code> function. Default is to use the
    <code>columns</code> property, in which case the
    <code>transform</code> function is supposed to output an array of
    the same length as it's input.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Structure of the variable</h3>

<p>Below is an example of the contents of a variable after it has been
used to store the data of two sweeps. Although it may seem a little bit
intimidating, it is worth taking a look at to get a feeling of what
information you have saved:</p>

<pre><code>{
  filetype: "<span class="string">NanoQt JSON data file</span>",
  creator: "<span class="string">NanoQt 0.2.0</span>",
  vim_modeline: "<span class="string"> vim: set filetype=javascript tabstop=8 noexpandtab:</span>",
  sample: {
    name: "<span class="string">ABC123</span>",
    description: "<span class="string">Some sort of nanotube</span>"
  },
  comment: "<span class="string">Some I(V) measurements after process foobar</span>",
  outputs: {
    1: {name: "<span class="string">Vds</span>", unit: "<span class="string">V</span>", scale: 10, description: "<span class="string">bias voltage</span>"},
    2: {name: "<span class="string">Vg</span>", unit: "<span class="string">V</span>", scale: 10, description: "<span class="string">gate voltage</span>"},
    3: {name: "<span class="string">H</span>", unit: "<span class="string">T</span>", scale: 5.2, description: "<span class="string">applied field</span>"}
  },
  inputs: {
    1: {name: "<span class="string">I</span>", unit: "<span class="string">nA</span>", scale: 100, description: "<span class="string">drain current</span>"}
  },
  measures: [                       <span class="comment">// array of measurements</span>
    {                               <span class="comment">// first measurement</span>
      comment: "<span class="string">Let's take an I(V) at zero field, zero gate</span>",
      temperature: 4.5,
      sweep: {
        from: {Vds: -10, Vg: 0, H: 0},
        to: {Vds: 10},
        duration: 2,
        sample_rate: 1000
      },
      columns: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"],        <span class="comment">// columns of the data matrix</span>
      start: "<span class="string">2009-05-25T17:17:57</span>", <span class="comment">// date/time of the first data point</span>
      data: [
        [-9.99, 2.69246],
        [-9.98, 0.632064],
        [-9.97, 0.135039],
        <span class="comment">// etc...</span>
        [9.99, 0.113934],
        [10, -0.0340331]
      ]
    },
    {                               <span class="comment">// second measurement</span>
      comment: "<span class="string">another I(V), now with an applied field</span>",
      temperature: 4.5,
      sweep: {
        from: {Vds: -10, Vg: 0, H: 0.5},
        to: {Vds: 10},
        duration: 2,
        sample_rate: 1000
      },
      columns: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"],
      start: "<span class="string">2009-05-25T17:19:23</span>",
      data: [
        [-9.99, -0.149949],
        [-9.98, -0.680474],
        [-9.97, -0.129733],
        <span class="comment">// etc...</span>
        [9.99, -0.0867593],
        [10, 0.0400066]
      ]
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the variable is an object with the following
properties:</p>

<dl>

    <dt>filetype, creator, vim_modeline</dt>
    <dd>This keys document the data format itself. They probably only
    make sense when you <code>save()</code> this variable to a
    file.</dd>

    <dt>sample, comment</dt>
    <dd>These keys are only examples. Actually it is the data given to
    the <code>set_metadata()</code> function that will be saved here.
    You have the choice of the keys and their associated values. This
    metadata is considered <i>global</i> as it applies to all the
    measurements stored in this variable.</dd>

    <dt>outputs, inputs</dt>
    <dd>This is the data you gave to the <code>set_outputs()</code> and
    <code>set_inputs()</code> functions respectively.</dd>

    <dt>measures</dt>
    <dd>This is an array of measurements. Each element of the array is
    an object containing the data stored by one sweep that used this
    variable as a data sink. The measurements have the following
    properties:
    <dl>

        <dt>comment, temperature</dt>

        <dd>These keys are only examples. Actually the contents of the
        <code>metadata</code> property of the data sink will be copied
        here. You have the choice of the keys and their associated
        values. This metadata is meant to document one specific
        measurement sweep.</dd>

        <dt>sweep</dt>

        <dd>Information about the sweep.</dd>

        <dt>columns</dt>

        <dd>Contents of the <code>columns</code> (or
        <code>output</code>, if relevant) property of the data sink.
        This gives the meaning of the columns of the data field.</dd>

        <dt>start</dt>

        <dd>Date and time when the first data point of this measurement
        was acquired, as a string in ISO 8601 format.</dd>

        <dt>data</dt>

        <dd>2D array with the actual raw data.</dd>

    </dl>
    </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Accessing the raw data</h3>

<p>As this data structure may seem quite complex, here are a few
shotcuts:</p>

<ul>
<li>If this variable is called <code>iv_measurements</code>, you can get the
number of measurements in it by typing
<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> n = iv_measurements.measures.length;</code></pre></li>
<li>If <code>i</code> is an integer in the range <i>0 ≤ i &lt; n</i>,
then the raw data of measurement <i>i</i> is
<pre><code>iv_measurements.measures[i].data</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>File data sinks</h2>

<p>A file data sink is very similar to a variable data sink, except that
the data is saved directly to a file instead of stored into a JavaScript
variable. A file data sink is created by defining a <code>save</code>
property to a sweep, which is an object with the following properties:</p>

<dl>

    <dt>filename (string)</dt>
    <dd>Name of the file. If the file does not already exist, it will be
    created. Otherwise the new data will just be appended to it. The
    preferred file extension is <code>".json"</code> for JSON files and
    <code>".ubj"</code> for UBJSON files.</dd>

    <dt>format (string)</dt>
    <dd>Optional name of the file format to use. Can be either
    <code>"json"</code> or <code>"ubjson"</code>. Default is
    <code>"json"</code>.</dd>

    <dt>columns (array of strings)</dt>
    <dd>List of (input or output) channels whose values are to be saved
    as data columns in the variable. Default is all the channels listed
    as outputs or inputs (in that order) on the current sweep.</dd>

    <dt>metadata (object)</dt>
    <dd>Extra information to document the measurement done in this
    particular sweep. Same as the metadata property of a variable data
    sink.</dd>

    <dt>transform (function)</dt>
    <dd>Optional function that will apply a mathematical transformation
    to the data. Same as for a variable data sink.</dd>

    <dt>output (array of strings)</dt>
    <dd>Optional array with the names you want to give to the outputs of
    the <code>transform</code> function. Same as for a variable data
    sink.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The file will be saved in either the
<a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> or
<a href="http://ubjson.org/">UBJSON</a> file format. JSON is a
text-based format holding the JavaScript literal expression of an
object. UBJSON is a more compact binary format sharing JSON's data
model. In both cases, the data structure is exactly the same as for a
variable data sink. You can read and write files in both formats with
commands such as:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Load UBJSON file into a variable.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> data = <span class="keyword">new</span> File("<span class="string">data.ubj</span>", "<span class="string">ubjson</span>").read();

<span class="comment">// Save the variable in a JSON file.</span>
<span class="keyword">new</span> File("<span class="string">data.json</span>", "<span class="string">json</span>").write(data);</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="api-file.html#file">help on accessing files</a> for
details.</p>

<h2>Tsv data sinks</h2>

<p>A tsv data sink is much like a file data sink, except that it only
saves the raw data and it saves it in tab-separated-values format. This
is the same format used by the <code>export_data()</code> function,
suitable for import in external software. The recommended file extension
for tab-separated-values files is ".tsv". Keep in mind that no metadata
is saved into the file, therefore it is recommended that you also save
the data in a regular file data sink.</p>

<p>A tsv data sink is created by defining a <code>tsv</code> property to
a sweep, which is an object with the same properties as a file data
sink, except for the missing <code>metadata</code> property and the
extra <code>prelude</code> and <code>postlude</code> properties:</p>

<dl>

    <dt>filename, columns, transform, output</dt>
    <dd>These properties have the same meaning in a tsv data sink as in
    a file data sink.</dd>

    <dt>prelude (string)</dt>
    <dd>Optional string to prepend to the data. Default is
    <code>"# <i>column_names</i>\n"</code> where
    <i>column_names</i> is the tab-separated list of column names. Set
    this to the empty string (<code>""</code>) to explicitly disable the
    prelude.</dd>

    <dt>postlude (string)</dt>
    <dd>Optional string to append to the data. Default is
    <code>"\n"</code> (an empty line). Set this to the empty string
    (<code>""</code>) to explicitly disable the postlude.</dd>

</dl>

<p>When using an explicit prelude and/or postlude, it is strongly
advised to end them with <code>\n</code> unless they are empty.</p>

<h2>Plot data sinks</h2>

<p>A plot data sink sends data to a plotter for real time visualization.
A plot data sink is created by defining a <code>plot</code> property to
a sweep, which is an object with the following properties:</p>

<dl>

    <dt>name (string)</dt>
    <dd>Name of the plot. Default is "Unnamed n" where n is a number
    incremented at each new unnamed plot. If a plot already exists with
    this name, a new curve will be drawn on it. Otherwise a new plot
    will be created.</dd>

    <dt>plot (Plot object)</dt>
    <dd>Plot object referencing an existing plot created by <code>new
    Plot()</code>. You should provide either a name or a plot property,
    but not both.</dd>

    <dt>axes (list of two strings)</dt>
    <dd>Names of the channels to plot in x and y axes (in that order).
    Defaults for a new plot are the first driven output channel (first
    in the outputs field of the current sweep) as x and the first input
    channel (first in the inputs) as y. If drawing on a pre-existing
    plot, the default is instead to use the same columns as those used
    the last time the plot was updated.</dd>

    <dt>transform (function)</dt>
    <dd>Optional function that will apply a mathematical transformation
    to the data. Same as for a variable data sink. This function should
    return an array of length two.</dd>

    <dt>columns (array of strings)</dt>
    <dd>Optional list of (input or output) channels to feed to the
    <code>transform</code> function above. Default is to use the
    <code>axes</code> property.</dd>

    <dt>new_curve (boolean)</dt>
    <dd>If sending the data to an existing plot, set this to
    <code>true</code> in order for the data to create a new curve (i.e.
    a new plot layer). Default is to continue to use the last used
    curve.</dd>

    <dt>options (object)</dt>
    <dd>Display options for the curve. The object should have the same
    format as the second parameter of the set_curve_options() Plot
    method. See the help on <a href="plot.html#set_curve_options">the 2D
    plotter</a> for details.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Multiple sinks of the same type</h2>

<p>You can define several data sinks for a single sweep in order to send
the data to several destinations at the same time. Although this
probably only makes sense for plots, you can also define several sinks
of the same type. You do so by replacing a sink definition by an array
of such definitions, as in the following:</p>

<pre><code>plot: [                   <span class="comment">// plot both I(V) and V(I)</span>
    { name: "<span class="comment">I(V)</span>", axes: ["<span class="comment">Vds</span>", "<span class="comment">I</span>"] },
    { name: "<span class="comment">V(I)</span>", axes: ["<span class="comment">I</span>", "<span class="comment">Vds</span>"] }
]</code></pre>

<p>You should <strong>not</strong> repeat the <code>plot</code> key
since no object can have two properties with the same name.</p>
