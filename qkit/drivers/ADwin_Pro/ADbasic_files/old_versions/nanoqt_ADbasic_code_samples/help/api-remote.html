<h1 align="center">Controlling instruments</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Although NanoQt is ADwin-centered, it can also communicate with other
instruments. Most modern instruments can be controlled through a TPC/IP
connection using an Ethernet cable. This is the preferred method. Legacy
instruments quite often offer only a GPIB (a.k.a. IEEE-488) interface.
NanoQt has no support for direct GPIB communication. However, GPIB
instruments can nevertheless be controlled by using an Ethernet/GPIB
gateway and talking to the gateway using the VXI-11 protocol.</p>

<p>NanoQt offers two options for Ethernet communication:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>TcpConnection()</code> constructor is suitable for
text-based, line-oriented protocols over a raw TCP connection. Many
Ethernet-enabled instruments can be controlled this way, using either <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Commands_for_Programmable_Instruments">SCPI</a>
commands or a custom text-based protocol.</li>
<li>The <code>Vxi11()</code> constructor is meant for controlling GPIB
instruments through a Ethernet/GPIB gateway, as well as directly
controlling instruments that natively implement a VXI-11 interface over
Ethernet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most LXI instruments accept SCPI commands over either a raw TCP
connection to port 5025 or a VXI-11 connection. Somme accept both.
Instruments conforming to LXI 1.2 and later provide an <i>XML
identification document</i> that can be queried through HTTP. This
document lists the available communication channels. The script
<code>lxi-identification.js</code>, available in the
<code>samples</code> subdirectory of the NanoQt distribution, can be
used to retrieve and parse this document. This can be done as
follows:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> identify = require("<span class="string">samples/lxi-identification.js</span>");
identify("<span class="string">192.168.0.3</span>");</code></pre>

The first line assumes the working directory is the parent of the
<code>samples</code> directory, otherwise the path to the script should
be replaced with the correct one. The second line attempts to identify
the instrument at address 192.168.0.3. The output may look like:

<pre><b>VISA address:</b> TCPIP::A-33510B-01068.local::inst0::INSTR
    you can connect with: new Vxi11("192.168.0.3")
<b>VISA address:</b> TCPIP::A-33510B-01068.local::5025::SOCKET
    you can connect with: new TcpConnection("192.168.0.3", 5025)</pre>


<h2>Direct TCP connections</h2>

<p>NanoQt can establish TCP connections with TCP-enabled instruments and
talk line-oriented protocols through these connections. In order to
establish a TCP connection, use the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> socket = <span class="keyword">new</span> TcpConnection("<span class="string">192.168.0.3</span>", 2001);</code></pre>

<p>where the first parameter of <code>TcpConnection()</code> is the IP
address (or host name) of the instrument and the second parameter is the
port number. The <code>new</code> keyword is optional. You are
nevertheless advised to keep it because it makes object-oriented
programmers feel good about you. Shall the force of the Great
Constructor be with you!</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can get a <i>non connected socket</i> (a socket is
the place where a connection gets plugged in) and connect it later:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> socket = <span class="keyword">new</span> TcpConnection();    	<span class="comment">// non connected socket</span>
socket.connect("<span class="string">192.168.0.3</span>", 2001);    <span class="comment">// now it is connected</span></code></pre>

<p>In both cases, <code>new TcpConnection()</code> returns an opaque
object representing the connection (or the non connected socket). Use
the following methods to act on this object:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>method</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>connect(address, port_number)</td>
    <td>If this is a non connected socket, connect to the given address
	and port. address may be an IP address (e.g. "192.168.0.3") or an
	internet host name (e.g. "foo.bar.com").</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>set_timeout(duration)</td>
    <td>Sets the timeout for reads to the given number of seconds (may
	be fractional).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>set_line_terminator(terminator)</td>
    <td>Sets the line terminator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>write(message)</td>
    <td>Send the given message to the peer. The line terminator will be
	automatically appended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>read()</td>
    <td>Read a line from the connection and return it. A line is defined
	by the line terminator. If a complete line is not available in the
	input buffer, read() will wait for more data until it can deliver a
	complete line or until it times out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>close()</td>
    <td>Close the connection. The socket is now disconnected and can be
	connected again with <code>connect()</code>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The default timeout is 0.5 s, which should be fine in most cases when
talking to locally-connected instruments but is too short for connecting
over the Internet. The default line terminator is <code>"\r\n"</code>.
Other popular choices are <code>"\n"</code> and <code>"\r"</code>. Their
meanings are:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
	<th>JavaScript code</th>
	<th>numeric value (hex)</th>
	<th>mnemonic</th>
	<th>name</th>
	<th>popular in</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>"\n"</td>
	<td>0x0A</td>
	<td>LF</td>
	<td>line feed</td>
	<td>Unix, Linux, MacOS X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>"\r"</td>
	<td>0x0D</td>
	<td>CR</td>
	<td>carriage return</td>
	<td>MacOS &le; 9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>"\r\n"</td>
	<td>0x0D 0x0A</td>
	<td>CRLF</td>
	<td>(CR followed by LF)</td>
	<td>DOS, Windows, Internet</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The manual of any TCP-enabled instrument should state the line
terminator that it uses.</p>


<h2>VXI-11</h2>

<img src="ics-8065.jpg" align="right">

<p>Legacy instruments that do not support TCP/IP can be controlled using
an <a href="https://www.icselect.com/vxi-11_gateway_8065.html">ICS
8065 Ethernet-to-GPIB controller</a> like the one pictured on the right.
This device is actually a gateway: connect the computer to the gateway
using an Ethernet cable, then connect the gateway to the instrument
using a GPIB cable. The instrument can then be controlled by the
computer using the VXI-11 protocol (a.k.a. TCP/IP Instrument
Protocol).</p>

<p>Some instruments natively support the VXI-11 protocol. These
instruments behave as GPIB instruments with an embedded Ethernet-to-GPIB
gateway.</p>

<p>To establish a connection to an instrument from NanoQt, use one of
the following syntaxes:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> instrument1 = <span
class="keyword">new</span> Vxi11(ip_address, device_name);
<span class="keyword">var</span> instrument2 = <span
class="keyword">new</span> Vxi11(ip_address, gpib_address);
<span class="keyword">var</span> instrument3 = <span
class="keyword">new</span> Vxi11(ip_address);                <span
class="comment">// networked VXI-11 instrument</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> instrument4 = <span
class="keyword">new</span> Vxi11(gpib_address);              <span
class="comment">// GPIB instrument behind the ICS 8065</span></code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ip_address</code> is the IP address of the instrument or
gateway, provided as a string. It defaults to
<code>"192.168.0.254"</code>, which is the default IP address of the
ICS 8065.</li>
<li><code>device_name</code> is the VXI-11 device name, as a string
typically of the form <code>"gpib0,XX"</code> or <code>"vxi0,XX"</code>,
where XX is the GPIB address. If not provided, it defaults to
    <ul>
    <li><code>"gpib0,XX"</code>, where XX is the provided GPIB address,
    as this is the convention used by the ICS 8065;</li>
    <li><code>"inst0"</code> if no GPIB address is provided, as this is
    common on networked instruments that natively support the VXI-11
    protocol.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li><code>gpib_address</code> is the GPIB address, as a number, used to
build the device name.</li>
</ul>

<p>The network settings of the ICS 8065, including its IP address,
can be changed through it's Web interface at
<a href="http://192.168.0.254/">http://192.168.0.254/</a>. The default
address can be restored by pushing the <i>LAN Reset</i> rear-panel
button.</p>

<p>The <code>new Vxi11()</code> call returns an opaque object
representing the connection to the instrument. Use the following methods
to act on this object:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>method</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>set_timeout(timeout)</td>
    <td>Sets the timeout for the GPIB side of the connection, i.e. how
    long the gateway will wait for the instrument to answer its
    requests. The timeout for the TCP/IP side of the connection (how
    long NanoQt will wait for the gateway) will be automatically set to
    the same value plus 200 ms. <code>timeout</code> should be given in
    seconds and can be fractional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>set_end(assert_end_line)</td>
    <td>If <code>assert_end_line</code> is <code>true</code>, then the
    gateway will be asked to send an IEEE-488 END indicator with the
    last data byte of all subsequent <code>write()</code>s. If
    <code>assert_end_line</code> is <code>false</code>, no END indicator
    will be sent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>set_termchr(chr)</td>
    <td>Define the termination character. All subsequent
    <code>read()</code>s will expect this character as an end-of-message
    indicator. All subsequent <code>write()</code>s will append this
    character to the message. If set to <code>'\0'</code> (or
    <code>0</code>, or <code>false</code>), the instrument will be
    expected to signal end of messages with an IEEE-488 END indicator
    and nothing will be automatically appended to
    <code>write()</code>s.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>write(message)</td>
    <td>Send this message to the instrument.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>read()</td>
    <td>Read a message from the instrument. Returns a string with the
    message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>readstb()</td>
    <td>Read the instrument's status byte. Returns the status byte as an
    integer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>trigger()</td>
    <td>Send an IEEE-488.2 TRIGGER control sequence to the
    instrument.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>clear()</td>
    <td>Send an IEEE-488.2 DEVICE CLEAR control sequence to the
    instrument.</td>
</tr>
</table>

to communicate with a Keithley 6514 electrometer.</p>


<h2>Remote Procedure Call</h2>

<p>The VXI-11 protocol is implemented on top of the ONC/RPC (Open
Network Computing / Remote Procedure Call) protocol, a.k.a. Sun RPC. A
subset of this protocol is available to the JavaScript interpreter for
debugging purposes. You normally do not want to use this! This quick
synopsis is provided here for reference only.</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> rpc = <span class="keyword">new</span> Rpc(host, program, version);
rpc.set_timeout(timeout_in_s);
<span class="keyword">var</span> response = rpc.call(procedure, args...);
<span class="keyword">var</span> length = response.length;
<span class="keyword">var</span> result = response.parse(type);</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>type</code> is either <code>"boolean"</code>,
<code>"number"</code> (meaning signed integer), <code>"unsigned"</code>
or <code>"string"</code>.</p>
