<h1 align="center">NanoQt gnuplot interface</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a> is a free
multi-platform plotting software. The good thing about gnuplot is that
it is very easy to interface programmatically. The bad thing is that the
graphical user interface is somewhat limited. NanoQt has a gnuplot
interface that can be used as an alternative to its native plotter. This
plotter should be quite stable and usable, but do not expect many
features to be added to it.</p>

<p>The plotter works by writing the data to be plotted into a temporary
file and spawning a separate process to run an instance of gnuplot that
does the actual plotting. There is one such temporary file and one
instance of gnuplot per plot window. On the JavaScript side, the pair
(temporary file, gnuplot instance) is represented by a <i>GnuPlot</i>
object, which is an <i>opaque</i> object in the sense that it contains
no user-visible data.</p>

<p>Many curves can be shown in a single plotter. They will be drawn in
different colors unless you run out of available colors.</p>

<p>The plotter can be used in two ways: for plotting existing data you
will create a GnuPlot object and send your data to it. To plot measured
data in real time you will add a gnuplot data sink to the relevant
sweep. See the sections below for details.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Obviously, you need to have
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a> installed in your system.
The gnuplot executable should live in one of the directories listed in
your PATH system variable in order for NanoQt to be able to find it.</p>

<p>Then, NanoQt should be compiled with gnuplot support. For this, you
need to have the following in NanoQt.pro:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG += gnuplot</code></pre>

<p>This is currently off by default.</p>


<h2>Plotting existing data</h2>

<p>Plots are described by GnuPlot objects. We will call them "GnuPlots"
for short. GnuPlots are created using the <code>new GnuPlot()</code>
construct. GnuPlots are objects on which several methods can be applied.
Typically, the <code>add_point()</code> method is used to add points one
at a time:</p>

<pre><code>plot = <span class="keyword">new</span> GnuPlot("<span class="string">sin(x)</span>");    <span class="comment">// "sin(x)" is the plot title</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> x = 0; x &lt; 2*PI; x += .0628)
    plot.add_point(x, sin(x));</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, a whole curve can be plotted with a single call to
<code>add_curve()</code>:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// First construct a curve</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> curve = [];
<span class="keyword">for</span> (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
    x = 2*PI*i/100;
    curve[i] = [x, cos(x)];
}

<span class="comment">// Then add it to the plot</span>
plot.add_curve(curve);</code></pre>

<p>The constructor is:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>constructor</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>new GnuPlot(<i>title</i>, <i>curve</i>)</td>

    <td>Creates a new GnuPlot object. Both <code>title</code> and
    <code>curve</code> are optional:
    <ul>

    <li>If <code>title</code> is provided, it should be a string. The
    actual window title will have "gnuplot:&nbsp;" prepended. If
    <code>title</code> is omitted, an empty string will be used
    instead.</li>

    <li>If <code>curve</code> is provided, the plot will be initialized
    with the data from the curve by calling <code>add_curve()</code>
    (see description below). If <code>curve</code> is omitted, the plot
    will be initialized with one empty curve and the plot window will
    not be opened: use <code>open()</code> if you want to see the
    (useless) empty plot.</li>

    <li>If one single parameter is provided, it will be interpreted as a
    title or as a curve depending on its type.</li>

    </ul>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Once created, the following methods can be applied to a GnuPlot:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>method</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>set_axis_labels(x_label, y_label)</td>
    <td>Sets the axis labels. <code>x_label</code> and
    <code>y_label</code> must be strings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>open()</td>
    <td>Opens the plot window. Not needed normally since
    <code>add_point()</code> and <code>add_curve()</code> will also open
    the window if it is not already open. Can be used to re-open a
    previously closed window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>add_point(<i>curve_idx</i>, x, y)</td>
    <td>Add a point at (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) on the curve
    number <i>curve_idx</i>. The curve number is optional and defaults
    to the current curve. Arguments should be numbers. The plot window
    will be opened if necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>new_curve(<i>title</i>)</td>
    <td>Starts a new empty curve that becomes the current curve. The
    curve title is optional. Future calls to <code>add_point()</code>
    will use this curve by default. This method has no effect if the
    current curve is empty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>add_curve(<i>title</i>, curve)</td>
    <td>Adds a new curve with the data in <code>curve</code>. The curve
    title is optional. The new curve becomes the current curve. The
    <code>curve</code> argument should be an array of arrays of two
    numbers. The plot window will be opened if necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>clear()</td>
    <td>Clears all the data (all curves) in the plot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>write(raw_command, ...)</td>
    <td>Send one or more string commands directly to the gnuplot
    process. Do <b>not</b> do this unless you know what you are
    doing!</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The current curve is always the last one created. There is no way to
add data to any other curve.</p>


<h2>Using gnuplot data sinks</h2>

<p>GnuPlots can be used as data sinks, much like regular plots. Just use
the "gnuplot" keyword instead of "plot":</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> sweep = {
    gnuplot: {
        name: "<span class="string">Vds vs I</span>",
        axes: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"]
    },
    <span class="comment">// + other sweep parameters...</span>
};</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new GnuPlot named "Vds vs I". Alternatively, it is
possible to use an existing GnuPlot: use the keyword "plot" instead of
"name":</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> dataplot = new GnuPlot("<span class="string">Vds vs I</span>");
<span class="keyword">var</span> sweep = {
    gnuplot: {
        plot: dataplot,    <span class="comment">// use existing plot</span>
        axes: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"]
     },
    <span class="comment">// + other sweep parameters...</span>
};
<span class="comment">// Now we can still play with dataplot.</span></code></pre>

<p>Formally, a gnuplot data sink is an object with the following
properties:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>key</th>
    <th>type</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>name (optional)</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Title of the GnuPlot that will be created by this data
    sink. If a GnuPlot with the same name was already created by a
    gnuplot data sink, it will be used instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>plot (optional)</td>
    <td>GnuPlot object</td>
    <td>Existing GnuPlot to reuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>axes</td>
    <td>array of two strings</td>
    <td>Names of the channels to use as x and y axes respectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>new_curve (optional)</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>If set to <code>true</code>, a new curve will be created to hold
    the incoming data. Default is <code>false</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>transform (optional)</td>
    <td>function</td>
    <td>Transformation to apply to the data prior to sending to the
    plot. The function should take an array of two numbers as it's
    single argument and return an array of two numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>columns (optional)</td>
    <td>array of strings</td>
    <td>Optional list of (input or output) channels to feed to the
    <code>transform</code> function above. Default is to use the
    <code>axes</code> property.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>When creating a gnuplot data sink, either give it a <code>name</code>
property (in order to create a new GnuPlot) or a <code>plot</code>
property (to reuse an existing plot). Do not give both. Do not omit
both.</p>
