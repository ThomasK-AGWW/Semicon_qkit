<h1 align="center">The NanoQt measurement API</h1>

<p>Doing a measurement consists of the following steps:</p>

<ul>

<li>Describe the <i>experimental setup</i>, i.e. what experimental
parameters are controlled or monitored by any of the ADwin's inputs or
outputs.</li>

<li>Describe the operations you want to be done. You do this by building
a data structure (either a <i>sweep descriptor</i> or a list of <i>sweep
descriptors</i>) that contain all the relevant information about your
measurement protocol.</li>

<li>Feed this information to one of the measurement functions (either
<code>measure()</code> or <code>measure_start()</code>) to actually
perform the measurement.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Simple example</h2>

<p>Let's assume you want to measure an I-V curve. You use the ADwin's
first analog output to polarise your sample by voltage through a 10
&Omega; shunt (much less than the sample impedance). You get the current
on input 1 by a differential measurement of the voltage drop through the
shunt. You first have to tell NanoQt about your wiring:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Ouput 1 controls the applied voltage.</span>
<span class="comment">// The full scale is 10 V.</span>
set_outputs({ 1: {name: "<span class="string">V</span>", unit: "<span class="string">V</span>", scale: 10} });

<span class="comment">// Input 1 measures the current.</span>
<span class="comment">// The full scale is 10 V / 10 &Omega; = 1 A.</span>
set_inputs({ 1: {name: "<span class="string">I</span>", unit: "<span class="string">mA</span>", scale: 1000} });</code></pre>

<p>Now you ask for an I-V measurement, let's say from -2 to +2 V. The
voltage will be scanned in 10 seconds:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Set the applied voltage to -2 V</span>
measure({ outputs: {V: -2} });

<span class="comment">// The actual measurement:</span>
measure({
    outputs: {V: 2},    <span class="comment">// scan the voltage to +2 V</span>
    duration: 10,       <span class="comment">// in 10 seconds</span>
    inputs: "<span class="string">I</span>",        <span class="comment">// while measuring the current</span>
    plot: {}            <span class="comment">// and plot the result</span>
});

<span class="comment">// Reset the applied voltage to zero</span>
measure({ outputs: {V: 0} });</code></pre>

<p>In the following, we will go on the details of this procedure,
building on a more complex example:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ADwin controls a bias voltage, a gate voltage and an applied
field</li>
<li>the current is measured through an current to voltage converter in
order to have a 10 µA full scale</li>
<li>the gate is driven through a high impedance resistor and requires
some settling time to stabilize</li>
<li>we may want to do either a bias sweep or a field sweep</li>
<li>we may want to save the data and not only plot it</li>
</ul>


<h2>Setup description</h2>

<p>You do this by calling <code>set_outputs()</code> and
<code>set_inputs()</code>. These functions take a description of your
wiring as in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>set_outputs({
    1: {name: "<span class="string">Vds</span>", unit: "<span class="string">V</span>", scale: 10, description: "<span class="string">bias voltage</span>"},      <span class="comment">// channel 1</span>
    2: {name: "<span class="string">Vg</span>" , unit: "<span class="string">V</span>", scale: 10, description: "<span class="string">gate voltage</span>"},      <span class="comment">// channel 2</span>
    3: {name: "<span class="string">B</span>"  , unit: "<span class="string">T</span>", scale:  3, description: "<span class="string">applied field</span>"}      <span class="comment">// channel 3</span>
});
set_inputs({
    1: {name: "<span class="string">I</span>", unit: "<span class="string">µA</span>", scale: 10, description: "<span class="string">sample current</span>"}      <span class="comment">// channel 1</span>
});</code></pre>

<p>In these objects, the keys are the channel numbers on the AIN and
AOUT cards of the ADwin. <code>unit</code> defaults to "V" and scale to
defaults 10, which corresponds to the raw scale (10 V) of the
converters. <code>description</code> is for reference only.</p>

<p>In addition to these two, it is advisable to call
<code>set_metadata()</code> and tell it any information that may be
useful about the sample or the experimental setup:</p>

<pre><code>set_metadata({
    sample: {
        name: "<span class="string">ABC123</span>",
        description: "<span class="string">Some sort of nanotube</span>"
    },
    comment: "<span class="string">Some I(V) measurements after process foobar</span>"
});</code></pre>

<p>You are completely free to use any key/value pairs you like in the
object given to <code>set_metadata()</code>. These are only meant to
document your experiment. The information you give here, together with
the wiring description above, will be copied to the header section of
any data file you subsequently create. <strong>Give here as much
relevant information as you can!</strong></p>

<h2>Sweep descriptors</h2>

<p>You have to mentally split your measurement protocol into a list of
<i>sweeps</i>. A sweep is basically the process of <i>linearly</i>
sweeping one or more output channels of the ADwin, while optionally
sampling one or more input channels at a constant sampling rate. Then
you have to build a sweep descriptor for every single sweep in your
protocol.</p>

<p>A sweep descriptor is a JavaScript object where the keys have
special meanings. A typical sweep looks like this:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> a_sweep = {
    outputs: {B: 1.5},          <span class="comment">// sweep the applied field to 1.5 T</span>
    duration: 30,               <span class="comment">// in 30 s</span>
    inputs: "<span class="string">I</span>",                <span class="comment">// while measuring the sample current</span>
    filters: ["<span class="string">median</span>", "<span class="string">linear</span>", "<span class="string">reset</span>"],
    sample_rate: 500,           <span class="comment">// 500 times per second</span>
    save: {                     <span class="comment">// save the data</span>
        filename: "<span class="string">sweep.json</span>",
        columns: ["<span class="string">Vg</span>", "<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">B</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"]
    },
    plot: {                     <span class="comment">// and plot it</span>
        name: "<span class="string">Current versus field</span>",
        axes: ["<span class="string">B</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"]
    }
};</code></pre>

<p>The relevant keys and their meanings are listed below. All keys are
optional: a default is provided for any missing key.</p>

<dl>

    <dt>duration (number)</dt>
    <dd>duration in seconds of this sweep. Default is 1 s.</dd>

    <dt>speed (number)</dt>
    <dd>speed of this sweep. Giving the speed is an alternative to
    giving the duration. <strong>Do not give both!</strong> The unit is
    whatever unit has the output that is swept, per second (e.g. if you
    sweep a field in tesla, speed is in T/s). If several outputs are
    swept, this is the euclidean norm of the vector speed. If several
    outputs are swept that have different units, then the euclidean norm
    probably does not make sense, give the duration instead.</dd>

    <dt>inputs (string or array of strings)</dt>
    <dd>Either the name of the input channel to monitor (if only one
    channel is to be measured) or a list of input channels to monitor.
    Default is not to monitor any input.</dd>

    <dt>modes (string or array of strings)</dt>
    <dd>Sweeping modes. The following are currently implemented:
    <dl>

		<dt>"lock-in"</dt>
        <dd>Activate the lock-in for this sweep. Look at the
        <a href="lock-in.html">lock-in documentation</a> for
        details.</dd>

        <dt>"quadratic"</dt>
        <dd>Do a quadratic sweep. In this mode, the initial velocity
        (i.e. time derivative) of any drive output equals the final
        velocity of this same output on the previous sweep. The final
        velocity will then be:
        <blockquote><i>2 * (target_value - initial_value)
        / duration - initial_velocity</i></blockquote></dd>

        <dt>"wait-trigger"</dt>
        <dd>Wait for a falling edge on the TTL input label "DIG I/O 0"
        of the CPU board before starting the current sweep. Use this to
        synchronize the sweep on an external source. Expect 10 &mu;s of
        jitter.</dd>

    </dl>
    Default is to do a linear sweep with no lock-in.</dd>

    <dt>filters (string or array of strings)</dt>
    <dd>Filters to aply to the inputs. Two filters are currently
    implemented:
    <dl>

        <dt>"median"</dt>
        <dd>Output of the filter is the median of the three last
        input values.</dd>

        <dt>"linear"</dt>
        <dd>Linear low-pass filter. This is a modified fourth-order
        Butterworth filter. The cutoff frequency is fixed at the Nyquist
        frequency of the acquisition, i.e. sample_rate/2. The filter has
        been modified in order to completely remove the sampling
        frequency and thus minimize the low-frequency noise.</dd>

    </dl>
    If both filters are requested, median is applied first. Filtering is
    done on the data acquired at the maximum acquisition rate (currently
    100 kHz), prior to decimating to the requested
    <code>sample_rate</code>. In addition to the above, the following
    keyword can appear in the list of filters:
    <dl>

        <dt>"reset"</dt>
        <dd>Reset the filters at the beginning of this sweep. This makes
        the filters loose their memory of past input. Otherwise the
        filtered outputs depend on the past as well as current input
        data.</dd>

    </dl>
    Default is not to filter the acquired data.</dd>

    <dt>sample_rate (number)</dt>
    <dd>Rate in Hz for sampling the inputs. Default is 1000 (i.e. 1
    kHz). Actually the data is always acquired at the maximum available
    rate, then subsampled to the requested rate. Subsampling is
    performed <strong>after</strong> filtering.</dd>

    <dt>outputs (object)</dt>
    <dd>List of the outputs to drive (channel names as keys) and their
    target values (as associated values). Default is not to modify any
    output.</dd>

    <dt>variable, save, plot (object or array of objects)</dt>
    <dd>These properties are called <i>data sinks</i>, they define what
    to do with the data as it is being acquired. You can store it in a
    JavaScript <code>variable</code>, <code>save</code> it to a file
    and/or <code>plot</code> it in real time. See the documentation on
    <a href="data-sinks.html">data sinks</a> for details.</dd>

    <dt>label (string or number)</dt>
    <dd>Optional label for the sweep. It will allow you to selectively
    wait for the termination of this particular sweep. See
    <code>measure_wait()</code> below. You have the responsibility to
    keep labels unique. Default is no label.</dd>

</dl>

<p>If the sweep has no properties (as in <code>var my_sweep =
{};</code>), the default behavior is to do nothing for one second.</p>

<p><b>More examples:</b></p>

<p>Simultaneously drive the gate voltage to -10 V and the bias voltage
to -5 mV in 2 s:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> prepare = { outputs: {Vg: -10, Vds: -5e-3}, duration: 2 };</code></pre>

<p>Pause (i.e. do nothing) for 5 seconds:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> pause = { duration: 5 };</code></pre>

<p>Measure sample current while sweeping Vds to +5 mV in 20 s. Plot with
default settings:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> scan = { outputs: {Vds: 5e-3}, inputs: "<span class="string">I</span>", duration: 20, plot: {} };</code></pre>

<p>Reset Vg and Vds to zero in one second:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> reset = { outputs: {Vg: 0, Vds: 0} };</code></pre>
