<h1 align="center">Accessing files and directories</h1>

<p>The <code>File</code> and <code>Directory</code> objects provide the
functionality needed to work with files and directories.</p>

<ul>

</ul>


<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<h3>Files</h3>

<p>Files can be accessed for reading and writing through the use of File
objects. These objects are created with the <code>new File()</code>
constructor. Then, the following methods can be used on the file:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>open()</code> opens the file for reading and/or writing; it
    also associates a codec to the file.</li>
<li><code>read()</code>, <code>readLine()</code>, <code>write()</code>
    and <code>writeLine()</code> access the contents of the file.</li>
<li><code>close()</code> closes the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following example code creates a text file with one single line
of text:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Create a new File object, this will not create the file yet.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> greeting = <span class="keyword">new</span> File("<span class="string">hello.txt</span>");

<span class="comment">// Open the file for writing, truncate it to zero length if it already</span>
<span class="comment">// exists, handle writes to the file in text mode.</span>
<span class="comment">// This will create the file if it does not already exist.</span>
greeting.open("<span class="string">write,truncate,text</span>");

<span class="comment">// Write a line of text, including a line terminator.</span>
greeting.writeLine("<span class="string">Hello, World!</span>");

<span class="comment">// Close the file.</span>
greeting.close();</code></pre>

<p>It is not always necessary to type all this code, as the File object
can implicitely open and close the file, and the <code>open()</code>
method has some sensible defaults. The code above could be also written
as follows:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Same as above, using implicit open() and close().</span>
<span class="keyword">new</span> File("<span class="string">hello.txt</span>", "<span class="string">truncate</span>").writeLine("<span class="string">Hello, World!</span>");</code></pre>

<p>In the above, it is worth noting that:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>open("truncate")</code> is called implicitely by the
    <code>new File()</code> constructor because the second argument is
    provided</li>
<li>the <code>"write"</code> mode is implicit when
    <code>"truncate"</code> is provided; likewise, <code>"text"</code>
    is the default codec</li>
<li>since the File object is not stored, it is automatically destroyed,
    and the destruction implicitely calls <code>close()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is advisable to always close, either explicitely or implicitely,
the files that are no longer needed. This is because there is a limit on
the total number of files that can be open at once.</p>

<h3>Directories</h3>

<p>NanoQt has a notion of a <i>current working directory</i>, which is
the default directory for reading or writing files. Whenever a file
dialog is opened, it's opened in the current working directory. When a
file name or directory name is used in a script, it can can be specified
either as an <i>absolute path</i> or a <i>relative path</i>. An absolute
path starts with a slash ("/"), optionally preceded by a drive letter
(e.g. "C:"), and should be understood as starting from the root of the
file system. A relative path (a path not starting with "/") is relative
to the current working directory. A couple of dots ("..") in a relative
path means "parent directory". Some examples:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Use an obsolute path.</span>
source("<span class="string">/home/user/experiment/scripts/initialization.js</span>");

<span class="comment">// Set the current working directory, then use a relative path.</span>
Directory.current = "<span class="string">/home/user/experiment/data</span>";
source("<span class="string">../scripts/measurement.js</span>");</code></pre>

<p>Directories can be manipulated through the <code>Directory</code>
object, which is a collection of directory-related properties and
functions. For example, <code>Directory.current</code> is the name of
the current working directory, and
<code>Directory.create(<i>dir_name</i>)</code> is a function used to
create directories. Note however that <code>Directory</code> is
<b>not</b> a constructor, i.e. <code>new Directory()</code> does not
make sense.</p>

<p>Below is an example code for creating a data directory named after
the current date, switching to it a writing a README file.</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Use a directory named after the current date.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> today = <span class="keyword">new</span> Date().toString("<span class="string">yyyy-MM-dd</span>"),
    dirname = "<span class="string">data_</span>" + today;

<span class="comment">// Create the directory if it does not already exist.</span>
<span class="keyword">if</span> (! <span class="keyword">new</span> File(dirname).exists) Directory.create(dirname);

<span class="comment">// Switch to the newly created directory.</span>
Directory.current = dirname;

<span class="comment">// Write a README file.</span>
<span class="keyword">new</span> File("<span class="string">README</span>", "<span class="string">truncate</span>").writeLine(
    "<span class="string">Data taken on sample foo on </span>" + today
);</code></pre>


<h2 id="file">File object</h2>

<h3>File constructor</h3>

<p>File objects are created with the following constructor:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>Constructor</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>new File(<i>path</i>, <i>open_mode</i>)</td>
    <td>

    <p>Creates a new File object representing a file that may or may not
    exist on disk.</p>

    <p><code><i>path</i></code> is the path to the file. It can be
    absolute or relative to the current working directory.</p>

    <p><code><i>open_mode</i></code> is optional. If provided, the file
    will be opened with this mode. See the <code>open()</code> method
    below.</p>

    </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Every File object thus created has the properties and methods listed
below.</p>

<h3>File properties</h3>

    <th>Property</th>
    <th>type</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>exists</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Whether the file actualy exists; this is <code>true</code> even

    <td>string</td>
    <td>The canonical name of the file. This is its absolute file path,
    including the file name, with all symbolic links, "." and ".."
    elements resolved. If the file does not exist, its

<h3>File methods</h3>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>open(<i>open_mode</i>, <i>metadata</i>)</td>
    <td>

    <p>Opens the file in the mode given by <i>open_mode</i>. See <a
    href="#modes">open modes</a> below. This method can be called
    explicitely, or implicitely by the constructor, or by the
    <code>read()</code>, <code>readLine()</code>, <code>write()</code>
    and <code>witeLine()</code> methods.</p>

    <p><code>metadata</code> is an optional object. If provided and the
    file is opened in write mode with the "tsv" codec, its contents will
    be written as comments at the beginning of the file, in the format
    "# keyword: value".</p>

    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>read()</td>
    <td>Reads the whole file and returns the data read. If the file is
    not open, it will be opened in "read" mode. The exact semantics
    depends on the <a href="#codecs">codec</a> in use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>readLine()</td>
    <td>Like <code>read()</code>, but reads only a line of the file (if
    it makes sense). The exact semantics depends on the
    <a href="#codecs">codec</a> in use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>write(data)</td>
    <td>Writes the provided data to the file. If the file is not open,
    it will be opened in "append" mode. The exact semantics depends on
    the <a href="#codecs">codec</a> in use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>witeLine(data)</td>
    <td>Like <code>write()</code>, but writes a single line of data to
    the file. The exact semantics depends on the <a
    href="#codecs">codec</a> in use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>close()</td>
    <td>Closes the file. This method is called implicitly if the File
    object is destroyed, i.e. if the script looses all references to
    it.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>File static methods</h3>

<p>The following functions are not methods of File objects (objects
returned by <code>new File()</code>) but of the <code>File</code>
constructor itself. They are thus always referred to as
<code>File.choose()</code> and <code>File.chooseMultiple()</code>.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>File.choose(<i>directory</i>)</td>
    <td>

    <p>Opens a file selection window allowing the user to select a
    single file. Returns the full path (directory and file name) of the
    selected file as a string. Returns an empty string if the user
    clicks the Cancel button.</p>

    <p>The <code><i>directory</i></code> argument is optional. If
    provided, it should be a string with the path of the initial
    directory for the file selection window. If not provided, the
    current working directory will be used.</p>

    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>File.chooseMultiple(<i>directory</i>)</td>
    <td>

    <p>Opens a file selection window allowing the user to select
    multiple files (with Control-click). Returns an array of strings,
    each being the full path of a selected file. Returns an empty array
    if the user clicks the Cancel button.</p>

    <p>The <code><i>directory</i></code> argument is optional. If
    provided, it should be a string with the path of the initial
    directory for the file selection window. If not provided, the
    current working directory will be used.</p>

    </td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2 id="modes">Open modes</h2>

<p>The open mode is a string with a comma-separated list of keywords.
Each keyword defines either an acces mode or a codec. Access modes can
be combined (e.g. <code>"read,write"</code> for read and write access),
but at most one codec can be used.</p>

<p>If only a codec is provided to <code>open()</code>, then the file is
not really opened, but the codec is remembered and will be used if a
subsequent <code>open()</code> provides an access mode and no codec.</p>

<h3>Access modes</h3>

<p>The access modes and their effect on <code>open()</code> are:</p>

<ul>

<li><code>"read"</code>: the file is opened for reading, throws an error
if the file does not exist or is not readable.</li>

<li><code>"write"</code>: the file is opened for writing, creates the
file if it does not exist, throws error if it is not writable.</li>

<li><code>"truncate"</code>: implies write; if the file exists, it is
truncated to zero length.</li>

<li><code>"append"</code>: implies write, write()s are done at the end
of the file, conflicts with truncate.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="codecs">Codecs</h3>

<p>A file is a sequence of 8-bit bytes. Since JavaScript has no data
type that directly maps to byte sequences, conversions must be done
on reading and writing. A codec is a set of rules that specify
the JavaScript data types that will be used for reading and writing, as
well as the conversions between these data types and the byte sequence
of the file. The following codecs are available.</p>

<ul>

<li><code>"text"</code>: File is text, in local charset, with local line
terminators. This is the default codec. The file is read and written as
strings, with '\n' as line terminators. Attempting to write characters
that do not belong to the local charset yields undefined behavior.</li>

<li><code>"utf-8"</code>: Like "text", but file is in UTF-8 irrespective
of local charset.</li>

<li><code>"binary"</code>: File is raw binary. It is read and written as
8-bit strings, i.e. strings consisting solely of characters in the range
[0:255]. This codec could be used to read and write text files in the
Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) charset, bot <b>not</b> in the very similar
Windows-1252 charset. No conversion of line terminators is performed.
Attempting to write characters outside the range [0:255] yields
undefined behavior.</li>

<li><code>"json"</code>: file is JSON.
This is a text-based format suitable for serializing complex data
structures made of objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans and
nulls. See <a href="http://json.org/">Introducing JSON</a> for
details.</li>

<li><code>"ubjson"</code>: file is UBJSON (Universal Binary JSON).
This is a binary format sharing JSON's data model. It is expected to be
far more space-efficient than JSON at the cost of not being
human-readable. See the <a href="http://ubjson.org/">Universal Binary
JSON specification</a> for details.</li>

<li><code>"tsv"</code>: File is a matrix of numbers in
delimiter-separated-values format. On writing, the delimiter is always a
tabulation character ('\t' = ASCII HT = 0x09). On reading, spaces and
commas are also accepted. The file is read and written as 2D arrays of
numbers. Individual lines are read and written as 1D arrays of numbers.
On reading, lines that cannot be parsed as lists of numbers are skipped
by default, but if a property named <code>skipEmptyLines</code> is set
to <code>false</code> on the file object, then these lines are read as
empty arrays.</li>

</ul>

<p>The chosen codec affects the semantics of the read and write
operations in the following way:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <td></td>
    <th>text, utf-8</th>
    <th>binary</th>
    <th>json, ubjson</th>
    <th>tsv</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>read()</th>
    <td>Returns the whole file as a string.</td>
    <td>Returns the whole file as an 8-bit string.</td>
    <td>Returns the whole file as an object.</td>
    <td>Returns the whole file as a 2D array of numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>readLine()</th>
    <td>Returns the next line of the file as a string, with the line
    terminator stripped.</td>
    <td>Returns the next bytes of the file up to the next '\n' (ASCII LF
    = byte 0x0a); the '\n' is not stripped.</td>
    <td>Throws an error.</td>
    <td>Returns the next line of data as a 1D array of numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>write()</th>
    <td>Stringifies its argument and writes it to the file.</td>
    <td>Stringifies its argument and writes it to the file.</td>
    <td>Writes its argument to the file.</td>
    <td>Writes a 2D array of numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>writeLine()</th>
    <td><code>write()</code>s its argument and adds a line terminator.</td>
    <td><code>write()</code>s its argument and adds a '\n' (ASCII LF =
        0x0a).</td>
    <td>Same as write().</td>
    <td>Writes a 1D array of numbers.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2 id="directory">Directory object</h2>

<p>As <code>Directory</code> is not a constructor, it only has static
properties and methods, i.e. properties and methods of the
<code>Directory</code> object itself.</p>

<h3>Directory static properties</h3>

    <th>Property</th>
    <th>type</th>
    <th>description</th>

    directory, a symlink...). The argument <i>path</i> is optional: if
    not given, the function returns a listing of
    <code>Directory.current</code>.</td>
