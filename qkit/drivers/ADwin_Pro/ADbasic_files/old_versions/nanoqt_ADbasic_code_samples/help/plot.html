<h1 align="center">The Plotter</h1>

<table class="plain" width="100%"><tr><td>

<p>The NanoQt plotter can be used to display a set of curves. Each curve
is a sequence of 2D data points. Points within a curve can be displayed
as symbols, connected by lines or both. Curves within a plot are
identified by a number called <b>curve index</b>. The first curve has
index zero. You have the choice to display any of the curves stored in
the plot, or to display all of them at once.</p>


<h2>The Plot Window</h2>

<p>The plot window has the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>the plot area, top right, holding the actual plot</li>
<li>the toolbox, top left (see description below)</li>
<li>the status line for displaying information</li>
<li>the setting tabs, at the bottom</li>
</ul>

<p>The setting tabs can be displayed or hidden by clicking on the
Settings button of the toolbox.</p>

<h3>The setting tabs</h3>

<p>This is a set of three tabs:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Axis &amp; Range</dt>
<dd>For setting the plot title, range and labels of the axes, autoscale
and subsampling. See the <a href="#props">plot obejct properties</a> for
details.</dd>

<dt>Marker &amp; Pen</dt>
<dd>For setting the appearance (color, line type, symbol...) of the
curves. The settings apply only to the currently displayed curve. If the
curve selector is set to &ldquo;all&rdquo;, then this tab is
disabled.</dd>

<dt>Others</dt>
<dd>For (de)activating the antialiasing and the display of the grid, and
setting the maximum number of tick intervals.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The settings in the first and third tab can be altered
programmatically using the <a href="#props">properties of the Plot
object</a> associated with the plot window. The settings of the
&ldquo;Marker &amp; Pen&rdquo; tab can be altered programmatically using
the <code><a href="#set_curve_options">set_curve_options()</a></code>
method of the Plot object.</p>

<h2>The JavaScript Interface</h2>

<p>From the JavaScript side, the plot window is represented by a <b>Plot
object</b> returned by the <code>new Plot()</code> constructor (see
below). The data stored in any curve is an array of points. Each point
is an array of two numbers. Thus, a complete curve is an array of arrays
of two numbers, like the following:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// A curve with four data points.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> curve_data = [ [0.2, 0.6], [2.1, 2.7], [4.8, 3.4], [3.2, 2.5] ];</code></pre>

<p>This is the format you have to use when sending data to a plot via
the <code>add_curve()</code> method. This is also the format of the data
returned by the <code>get_data()</code> method. Both methods are
described below, after the constructor.</p>

<p>At any time, there is one curve in the plot that is the <b>current
curve</b>. The current curve is the one that will collect the data you
send to the plot unless you explicitely specify otherwise. You can query
and change the current curve programmatically (see the <a
href="#props">Plot object properties</a> below). This is different from
the <b>displayed curve</b> that you set with the curve selector on the
plot window. Changing the displayed curve has no effect on the current
curve. However, changing the current curve does change the displayed
curve in order to make the current curve visible, unless the displayed
curve is set to &ldquo;all&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Constructor</h3>

<p>Plots are created using the <code>new Plot()</code> constructor. It
is advisable (but not mandatory) to provide a title to the constructor.
You can also provide data to plot, if it is already available. If not,
an empty plot is created. You will be able to add data to it later.</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Make some random data.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> data = [];
<span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> i = 0; i &lt; 200; i++) data[i] = [random(), random()];

<span class="comment">// Plot it.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> plot = <span class="keyword">new</span> Plot("<span class="string">Random data</span>", data);</code></pre>

<p>The syntax of the constructor:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>Constructor</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>new Plot(<i>title</i>, <i>curve</i>...)</td>
    <td>

    <p>Creates a new plot window.</p>

    <p>The title is optional. If provided, it should be the first
    argument. The default title is &ldquo;unnamed&rdquo;. The unicity of
    the title will enforced by adding a number after the requested title
    if necessary. The title can be used to later retrive a reference to
    the plot (see <code>Plot.find()</code> below). It will be displayed
    on the top of the plot area, and also in the plot window&rsquo;s
    title bar prefixed by "Plot:".</p>

    <p>Providing curves in the constructor is optional. The provided
    curves, if any, will become curves 0, 1...</p>

    <p>The constructor returns an opaque Plot objet representing the
    plot window. You can then act on the plot using the methods and
    properties below.</p>

    </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The object returned by the <code>new Plot()</code> construct serves
as a handle to control the plot. Make sure to store this object in a
variable. If you later <code>delete</code> this variable, the plot
window will be destroyed. Beware that not storing the returned plot
object is just like deleting it right away!</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p><code>new Plot()</code> returns a Plot object that serves as a handle
to the plot. You can act on the plot by calling methods of this object
like:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Make it look more like a scatter plot.</span>
plot.set_curve_options(0, { pen_style: "<span class="string">none</span>" });

<span class="comment">// Add more data.</span>
plot.new_curve();
<span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> x = 0; x &lt; 1; x += 0.01) plot.add_point(x, exp(-x));</code></pre>

<p>The followind methods are available:</p>

<p id="set_curve_options">The <code>set_curve_options()</code> method
can be used to modify any of the settings in the Marker &amp; Pen tab.
Here is another example of set_curve_options():</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Some options for curve 1:</span>
plot.set_curve_options(1,
    {
        pen_style: "<span class="string">dash</span>",
        pen_width: 2,
        pen_color: "<span class="string">blueviolet</span>",
        symbol: "<span class="string">none</span>"
    }
);</code></pre>

<p>The second parameter of <code>set_curve_options()</code> and the
returned value from <code>get_curve_options()</code> are objects that
can have any of the following properties:</p>

<dl>

<dt>pen_style (string)</dt>
<dd>Any of "none", "solid", "dash", "dot", "dash dot" or "dash dot dot".
Set it to "none" if you do not want the data points to be joined by
lines.</dd>

<dt>pen_width (integer)</dt>
<dd>With of the lines. Applies to bot the lines connecting data points
and the contour of hollow symbols. Width zero is equivalent to one if
antialiasing is on (default), otherwise it means to use a simplified
line drawing algorithm.</dd>

<dt>pen_color (string)</dt>
<dd>Color of the curve. You can use either a named color (any name you
see in the list on the Marker &amp; Pen tab) or an hexadecimal RGB
triplet in the #RRGGBB format (for example, "#9999ee" is a shade of
light blue).</dd>

<dt>symbol (string)</dt>
<dd>Any of "none", "plus", "cross", "asterisk", "circle", "square",
"diamond", "triangle up", "triangle down" or "star". Set it to "none" if
you do not want symbols drawed.</dd>

<dt>symbol_filled (boolean)</dt>
<dd>Whether the drawed symbols are to be filled or kept hollow. Beware
that the symbols "none", "plus", "cross" and "asterisk" are not
fillable.</dd>

<dt>symbol_size (integer)</dt>
<dd>Size of the symbols (diameter) in pixels. If the symbol is hollow,
the actual size is larger by the width of the pen.</dd>

</dl>

<p>When used as a parameter of <code>set_curve_options()</code>, all the
properties of this object are optional. Any missing property will cause
<code>set_curve_options()</code> to <b>not</b> modify the corresponding
setting. In contrast, the <code>get_curve_options()</code> method
returns a similar object with <b>all</b> of the above properties
present.</p>

<h3 id="props">Properties</h3>

<p>The plot object has also some properties that are special in the
sense that they affect the plot&rsquo;s appearance or behavior.
Modifying these properties is another way of acting on the plot.
The <code>current_curve</code> property lets you choose the default
destination of data sent through <code>add_point()</code>. All the other
properties control the same settings as the first (Axis &amp; Range) and
third (Other) setting tabs. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Add some annotations.</span>
plot.y_label = "<span class="string">latitude</span>";
plot.x_label = "<span class="string">longitude</span>";
plot.title = "<span class="string">Cities I visited</span>";

<span class="comment">// Show the grid.</span>
plot.grid = <span class="keyword">true</span>;</code></pre>

<p>All of the following properties can be queried and modified:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

    <th>Property</th>
    <th>type</th>
    <th>description</th>

    <td>Index of the curve to be displayed. Set this to -1 to display
    all the curves. If set to anything other than -1,
    <code>new_curve()</code>, <code>add_point()</code> and
    <code>add_curve()</code> automatically set this to
    <code>current_curve</code>.</td>

<h3>Static methods</h3>

<p>In some cases it may happen that you loose track of your plot object. You still know its title
though, since it is displayed in the plot window itself. You may then
use the function <code>Plot.find()</code> to recover a handle on you
plot:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Get the same plot again.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> same_plot = Plot.find("<span class="string">Cities I visited</span>");

<span class="comment">// Now we can play with it again.</span>
same_plot.clear(1);
same_plot.title = "<span class="string">Cities I would like to visit</span>";
same_plot.save("<span class="string">cities-plot.json</span>");</code></pre>

<p>Technically, this is called a <i>static</i> method because it is not
a method of the Plot objects (objects returned by <code>new
Plot()</code>). It is instead a method of the <code>Plot</code>
constructor itself, always referenced as <code>Plot.find</code>.</p>

<p>A second static method, <code>Plot.open()</code>, allows to restore a
previously saved plot:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Restore a saved plot.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> plot_copy = Plot.open("<span class="string">cities-plot.json</span>");</code></pre>

<p>These are the only two static methods available:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Plot.find(title)</td>
    <td>Returns a Plot object representing the plot that has the given
    title. This object is equivalent to the one originally returned by
    <code>new Plot()</code>. If no plot has the given title, returns an
    undefined value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Plot.open(filename)</td>
    <td>Creates a new plot that is a copy of a previously saved plot
    (see the <code>save()</code> method above). Returns a Plot object
    representing the newly created plot.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>There is however a slight difference between the plot object returned
by <code>Plot.find()</code> and the one originally returned by <code>new
Plot()</code>: deleting the one returned by <code>Plot.find()</code>
will not destroy the plot window.</p>

<h3>Static properties</h3>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>type</th>
    <th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Plot.curve_options</td>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>Default display options for all subsequently created plots.
    Assigning an object to this property is equivalent to assigning the
    same object to all subsequently created plots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Plot.grid</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Default <code>grid</code> property for all subsequently created
    plots. Initially <code>false</code>. Assigning a value to this
    property is equivalent to assigning it to all subsequently created
    plots.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>The plot data sink</h2>

<p>Plots can be used as data sinks. To use an existing plot as a data
sink, add a <code>plot</code> property to a relevant sweep:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Create a new plot to hold the I(Vds) data.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> I_vs_Vds = new Plot("<span class="string">I(Vds)</span>");

<span class="comment">// Set it as a data sink for a sweep.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> sweep = {
    // The other sweep parameters go here...</span>
    ...
    plot: { plot: I_vs_Vds, axes: ["<span class="string">Vds</span>", "<span class="string">I</span>"] }
};

<span class="comment">// Do the measurement.</span>
measure(sweep);</code></pre>

<p>For details see the documentation on <a href="data-sinks.html">data
sinks</a>.</p>

<p>More examples on using the plotter can be found in the samples
directory: plot.js, plot-sink.js and lasso+plot.js.</p>
