<h1 align="center">Modules</h1>

<p>Reusable pieces of JavaScript code can be stored as “modules”
–&nbsp;a concept similar to “libraries” in other programming
environments&nbsp;– and then imported into other scripts. NanoQt
provides a module system heavily inspired by the module system of
<a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.</p>

<p>A module is simply a script providing code that can be “required”
(i.e., imported) by another script. Within the module, there is an
object named <code>exports</code>, which is initially empty and meant to
serve as a container for all the things that should be made available
(i.e., “exported”) by the module to the requiring script. This object is
returned to the requiring script as the return value of the
<code>require()</code> function.</p>

<p>As an example, here is a simple module defining a few trigonometric
functions:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">/* Trigonometric functions not provided by the language. */</span>
exports.cot = <span class="keyword">function</span>(x) { <span class="keyword">return</span> 1/tan(x); }; <span class="comment">// cotangent</span>
exports.sec = <span class="keyword">function</span>(x) { <span class="keyword">return</span> 1/cos(x); }; <span class="comment">// secant</span>
exports.csc = <span class="keyword">function</span>(x) { <span class="keyword">return</span> 1/sin(x); }; <span class="comment">// cosecant</span></code></pre>

<p>This module exports an object with three properties, named
<code>cot</code>, <code>sec</code> and <code>csc</code>, which are all
functions. Assuming the module is named "trig-functions.js" and resides
in the same directory as the script that is going to import it, it can
be used as follows:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Import the trigonometry module as the object "trig".</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> trig = require("<span class="string">./trig-functions.js</span>");

<span class="comment">// Now the secant function is available as "trig.sec".</span>
echo("<span class="string">secant of π/4 = </span>" + trig.sec(PI/4));</code></pre>

<p>If only one of the provided items needs to be imported, this can be
done as follows:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Import only the secant function.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> sec = require("<span class="string">./trig-functions.js</span>").sec;

<span class="comment">// Now the secant can be simply called "sec".</span>
echo("<span class="string">secant of π/4 = </span>" + sec(PI/4));</code></pre>


<h2>Writing modules</h2>

<p>A module is any JavaScript file that exports some items meant to be
useful to other scripts, but there are some points one should be aware
of:</p>

<h3>Variable scope</h3>

<p>Variables defined within a module are private to that module. Only
the values assigned as properties of the <code>export</code> object will
be visible from outside the module. These properties can be of any type:
functions (as in the example above), numbers, objects, etc.</p>

<h3>Exporting a single item</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may want to export a single item rather than a
collection of properties. This is often the case when the module has the
sole purpose of defining a constructor. In this case, the item can be
assigned to <code>module.exports</code>. It will then be the value
returned by <code>require()</code>. For example, the following
module:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Construct a flux capacitor.</span>
<span class="keyword">function</span> FluxCapacitor()
{
    ...
}

<span class="comment">// Export only the constructor.</span>
module.exports = FluxCapacitor;</code></pre>

<p>would be used as this:</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Import the flux capacitor constructor.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> FluxCapacitor = require("<span class="string">./flux-capacitor.js</span>");

<span class="comment">// Construct an instance.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> my_flux_cap = <span class="keyword">new</span> FluxCapacitor();</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important note</strong>: The <code>exports</code> variable is
initialized as a reference (a kind of shortcut) to
<code>module.exports</code>, which is itself initialized as an empty
object. Assigning a new value to <code>exports</code> will
<strong>not</strong> work, as that will only change the local
<code>exports</code> variable, which will no longer be linked to
<code>module.exports</code>. Always assign to
<code>module.exports</code> if you want to replace (rather than
populate) the exported object.</p>

<h3>Running a module as a script</h3>

<p>As a single file can be run as a regular script or imported as a
module, it is sometimes desirable to provide different behaviors
depending on how the file is run. For example, a module may include some
test code meant to be executed only when the file is run as a script.
This can be done by performing the test
<code>require.main&nbsp;===&nbsp;module</code>, which yields
<code>true</code> only in non-module context. For instance:</p>

<pre><code><span class="keyword">if</span> (require.main === module) {
    <span class="comment">// This file has been loaded as a regular script.</span>
} <span class="keyword">else</span> {
    <span class="comment">// This file has been loaded as a module.</span>
}</code></pre>


<h2>Module search path</h2>

<p>Required modules are searched in a list of directories called “search
path”. This list depends on whether the argument provided to
<code>require()</code> as the module name is an absolute file path, a
relative path, or a “pathless” name. In the last two cases, the search
will make use of a “base directory”, which is defined below.</p>

<p>Within each of the directories in the search path,
<code>require()</code> will attempt to load the module as a file, using
the module name as a file name. If that fails, it will attempt appending
".js" to the module name, then "/index.js".</p>

<p>This last feature means a module can be implemented as a collection
of files kept together in a single directory. Calling
<code>require()</code> with the name of the directory as the module name
will load the file index.js from that directory. This file, which is the
main entry point of the module, can then load the other files from the
directory.</p>

<h3>Base directory</h3>

<p>If the code calling <code>require()</code> comes from a file, then
the base directory is the directory containing that file. This is the
case when <code>require()</code> is called:</p>

<ul>
<li>from a module that is itself being loaded with
<code>require()</code></li>
<li>from a script that is being loaded by a call to
<a href="api-general.html#system"><code>source()</code></a></li>
<li>from a script started from a NanoQt script window that has been
loaded
from a file or saved to a file</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in the last case the script may have unsaved changes. The
base directory will nevertheless be the directory containing the last
saved version of the file.</p>

<p>There are two situations where the calling script cannot be related
to any specific file:</p>

<ul>
<li>a script written in a NanoQt script window that has never been
saved</li>
<li>script code typed at the NanoQt console</li>
</ul>

<p>In both those cases, the base directory is the current working
directory, i.e. <a
href="api-file.html#directory"><code>Directory.current</code></a>.</p>

<h3>Absolute path</h3>

<p>If the argument passed to <code>require()</code> starts with a "/"
character, it is interpreted as an absolute path. For example:</p>

<pre><code>require("<span class="string">/home/joe/modules/multimeter.js</span>");</code></pre>

<p>In this case the module is searched only in the specific path
provided in the argument.</p>

<h3>Relative path</h3>

<p>If the argument to <code>require()</code> contains at least one "/"
character and is not an absolute path, then it is interpreted as a path
relative to the base directory defined above. For example, if the base
directory is "/home/joe/experiment", then the call</p>

<pre><code>require("<span class="string">./multimeter.js</span>");</code></pre>

<p>will attempt to load "/home/joe/experiment/multimeter.js".</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This behavior is specific to the
<code>require()</code> function. In other contexts, such as <a
href="api-file.html#file">the <code>File()</code> constructor</a>,
relative paths are always interpreted as being relative to the current
working directory, irrespective of the location of the calling
script.</p>

<h3>Pathless name</h3>

<p>If the argument to <code>require()</code> does not contains a "/", it
is a “pathless” module name. The module is then searched in an ordered
list of directories which is built as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>the subdirectory "nanoqt_modules" of the base directory</li>
<li>the subdirectory "nanoqt_modules" of the <em>parent</em> of the base
directory</li>
<li>...and so forth up to the "nanoqt_modules" directory in the file
system root</li>
<li>the directories listed in the <code>$NANOQT_PATH</code> environment
variable, if
that variable is defined an non empty</li>
<li>the directories within a fallback path defined at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the <code>$NANOQT_PATH</code> environment variable and the
fallback path should be lists of absolute paths to directories,
separated by colon (<code>:</code>) characters (semicolons on
Windows).</p>

<p>The fallback path is defined in NanoQt.pro. It defaults to the single
directory where the <code>make install</code> command installs the
modules provided with NanoQt (namely /usr/local/lib/nanoqt/modules).</p>

<p>For example, if the base directory is "/home/joe/experiment", and
assuming <code>$NANOQT_PATH</code> is unset and the fallback path is the
default one, then the call</p>

<pre><code>require("<span class="string">multimeter.js</span>");</code></pre>

<p>will try to load in turn:</p>

<ul>
<li>/home/joe/experiment/nanoqt_modules/multimeter.js</li>
<li>/home/joe/nanoqt_modules/multimeter.js</li>
<li>/home/nanoqt_modules/multimeter.js</li>
<li>/nanoqt_modules/multimeter.js</li>
<li>/usr/local/lib/nanoqt/modules/multimeter.js</li>
</ul>
